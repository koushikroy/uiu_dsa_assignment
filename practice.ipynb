    "# ASSIGNMENT\n",
    "# Q2: THE SECRET MAGIC TRIP\n",
    "# Marvel is a land with N cities (numbered 1 through N) connected by M bidirectional roads. Dr. Strange\n",
    "# is on a mission to spread a secret Magic. He has a sequence A1,A2,…,AK and he must visit cities in\n",
    "# the following way: he starts in the city A1, travels to the city A2, then travels from there to the city A3 and\n",
    "# so on until he reaches the city AK. Note that a city may appear in the sequence A for multiple times,\n",
    "# but Ai ≠ Ai+1 for each valid i. When travelling between two cities, Dr. Strange always follows one of the\n",
    "# shortest paths between them (but not necessarily the same one if he travels between them again).\n",
    "# The government is trying to track which cities are targeted by Dr. Strange. However, they do not know\n",
    "# the sequence A. Instead, they have tracked Dr. Strange's movement as a sequence B1, B2…,BL of\n",
    "# cities visited by him during his mission. Formally, B1=A1 is the city where Dr. Strange starts, then for\n",
    "# each valid i, he moves from the city Bi to the city Bi+1 using the direct road between them and finally,\n",
    "# he ends his mission in the city BL=AK; Dr. Strange's sequence A is a subsequence of B, since the\n",
    "# sequence B also contains all shortest paths which Dr. Strange followed. It is guaranteed that there is\n",
    "# a direct road between cities Bi and Bi+1 for each valid i.\n",
    "# Help the government of Marvel find the minimum possible number of targeted cities, i.e. the minimum\n",
    "# possible value of K for a sequence A that corresponds to the given sequence B, or determine that no\n",
    "# such sequence A exists.\n",
    "# Input: The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The\n",
    "# description of T test cases follows.\n",
    "# ➢ The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and L.\n",
    "# ➢ The second line contains L space-separated integers B1, B2…,BL\n",
    "# ➢ Each of the following M lines contains three space-separated\n",
    "# integers u, v and w describing a road between cities u and v with length w.\n",
